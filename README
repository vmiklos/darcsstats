= Simple statistics generator for darcs
Miklos Vajna <vmiklos@vmiklos.hu>

== What's darcsstats?

darcsstats is a simple statistics generator for
link:http://darcs.net/[darcs] repositories.

== Status

I wrote it as a homework with the following conditions:

- should be written in C

- using external libraries are not allowed

It works fine, but probably such a tool could be just written in a
script language, or at least it could use GList instead of the current
internal linked list implementation.

Also, as I no longer use darcs these days, it's kind of unmaintained but
as far as I know it still works properly with the latest stable version
of darcs.
